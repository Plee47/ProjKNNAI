# ProjKNNAI
This project implements the K-nearest neighbors algorithm using Scikit-learn library in Python. The algorithm can be used for classification tasks in various practical applications such as medical diagnosis, fraud detection, image recognition, and more. The accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated using the accuracy score function.
